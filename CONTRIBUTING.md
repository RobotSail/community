# Contributing

üëçüéâ First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What to Know Before Getting Started

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

Please report unacceptable behavior to one of the [Code Owners](./CODEOWNERS).

## Contributing in General

Our project welcomes external contributions. To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

Also important to note is that you need to agree to the terms of [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) by signing off your commits. We automatically verify that all commit messages contain a `Signed-off-by:` line with your email address. We can only accept PRs that have all commits signed off. If you didn't sign off your commits before creating the pull request, no worries, you can fix that after the fact.

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new Features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing Bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge Approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers and triagers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Ways to Contribute to InstructLab

### Taxonomy

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests for documentation updates, skills contributions, knowledge contributions and more. Note: knowledge contributions will not be considered at launch but will be accepted at a later date.
See the [Taxonomy's contribution guide](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### CLI

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests for documentation updates, code contributions and more.
See the [CLI's contribution guide](https://github.com/instruct-lab/cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Legal

### License and Copyright

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
/*
Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```
### DCO

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) - that the Linux¬Æ Kernel [community](https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

### Useful Tools to Make Doing DCO Signoffs Easier

There are a number of great tools out there to manage DCO signoffs for developers to make it much easier.

- DCO command line tool, which let's you do a single signoff for an entire repo ( <https://github.com/coderanger/dco> )
- GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically ( <https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui> )
- Chrome - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo>
- Firefox - <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scott-rigby/?src=search>
