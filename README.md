## Overview
InstructLab is an automated instruction-based model tuning method and toolset that accelerates and standardized model knowledge and skill composition and alignment to instruction following. It utilizes a model content and prompt behavior configuration standard to specify, and then generate and refine synthetic training data and deploy it through a novel training method. This process enables adding user-specified knowledge and skills (a “model pull request”) to various open model baselines, and merge various pull requests (model “merge”) into a single model. It also results in standardized and predictable prompting behavior even as the model content and alignment changes, Tests today have demonstrated rapid cycles of progress with small teams (~few developers) updating various open models with new skills and higher accuracy benchmarking (e.g. MT Bench). 


## Goals
This open-source community effort must accomplish, at least, the following goals:
* Build out, validate, and drive adoption of the InstructLab tooling and model API standard.
* Grow ecosystem of open data (inputs) and open models (outputs) as enablers and proof points.
* Establish deployable app patterns, practices and proof points for sophisticated use cases.

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.
Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For
example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
