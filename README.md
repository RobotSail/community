# InstructLab Community ðŸ”¬
The mission of the InstructLab project is to leverage innovative techniques to overcome the scalability challenges in the instruction-tuning phase of large language model (LLM) training. InstructLab leverages a taxonomy driven curation process along with synthetic data generation to enable an open source community to submit contributions to existing LLMs without the need to fully fork and fine-tune.

This repository shares InstructLab's governance and collaboration across the community. You should be able to find the most relevant and current information below (and your issues/pull requests are more than welcome to help us maintain this information).

## Community Goals
This open-source community effort must accomplish, at least, the following goals:
* Build out, validate, and drive adoption of the InstructLab tooling and model API standard.
* Grow ecosystem of open data (inputs) and open models (outputs) as enablers and proof points.
* Establish deployable app patterns, practices and proof points for sophisticated use cases.
