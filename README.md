# InstructLab Community ðŸ”¬
The Mission of the InstructLab project is to leverage innovative techniques to overcome the scalability challenges in the instruction-tuning phase of large language model (LLM) training. InstructLab leverages a taxonomy driven curation process and synthetic data generation to enable an open source community to submit contributions to existing LLMs without the need to fully fork and fine-tune.

## Community Goals
This open-source community effort must accomplish, at least, the following goals:
* Build out, validate, and drive adoption of the InstructLab tooling and model API standard.
* Grow ecosystem of open data (inputs) and open models (outputs) as enablers and proof points.
* Establish deployable app patterns, practices and proof points for sophisticated use cases.
